# Home Automation (Dummy Project)

*********************

## Abstract

The goal for this dummy project is to develope a backbone for an all in one home automation unit. The requirements layed out in this document
will by no means be all this project will encompass. The idea is to have scalability in mind as some of the aspect can become quite cumbersome
while others my only take a few hours to implement. To begin, there will be 4 main components which will serve as a foundation for the rest.
Since this unit will essentially be controlling my entire house, it makes me susceptible to hacking. Naturally, security will be a large part
of this final design as I'd be happier if my shit wasn't stolen. This in turn means that every component will run some form of linux
(including the wifi router).

## Foundation

Thankfully the requirements for this assignment align with how I want things done. The final result will include:

1. A fully functioning web site which will allow me to access the unit outside of work
2. The non graphical component will of course be the logic behind the google home and the machine learning
3. A database will be implemented to handle all of the logging for the system
4. In the home computer, there will be a Qt application to run and maintain all of the other components.
